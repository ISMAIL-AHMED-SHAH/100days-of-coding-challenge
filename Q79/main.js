// Question 79: Creating and Accessing Object Properties: Construct an object representing a car with properties for make, model, and year. Then, show how you can access the model property of the car.
// This sets up an object for a car with specific details
var car = {
    make: "Toyota",
    model: "Camry",
    year: 2024
};
// Accessing and showing the car's model using dot notation
console.log(car.model); // Outputs: Corolla
// Accessing and showing the car's model using bracket notation
console.log(car["model"]); // Outputs: Corolla
