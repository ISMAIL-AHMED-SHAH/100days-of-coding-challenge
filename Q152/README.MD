Day-52 Task: Read the following article: An Introduction to JavaScript

Let’s see what’s so special about JavaScript, what we can achieve with it, and what other technologies play well with it. This article will give you a brief overview of JavaScript and its capabilities. It’s a great starting point for beginners and a good refresher for experienced developers.

What is JavaScript?

    A scripting language designed to make web pages interactive.
    Runs in web browsers and doesn't require special compilation.
    Different from Java, despite the name.

How Does it Work?

    Browsers have built-in JavaScript engines that "parse" and "compile" the code.
    Compiled code runs quickly and is further optimized during execution.

What Can In-Browser JavaScript Do?

    Modify and manipulate web pages (HTML, content, styles).
    Respond to user interactions (clicks, scrolls, key presses).
    Make network requests (download/upload files, AJAX, COMET).
    Manage cookies, display messages, and store user data locally.

What Can't In-Browser JavaScript Do (Security Reasons)?

    Access user's files or hardware directly.
    Communicate with other tabs/windows from different sites (Same Origin Policy).
    Run programs or access the operating system.

What Makes JavaScript Unique?

    Tight integration with HTML and CSS.
    Simple syntax for basic tasks.
    Supported by all major browsers by default.

Languages "Over" JavaScript (Transpiling)

    Languages like CoffeeScript, TypeScript, Flow, Dart, Brython, and Kotlin can be transpiled to JavaScript for browser use.
    These languages offer features like syntactic sugar, data typing, or standalone functionality.

Summary

    JavaScript started as a browser language but has expanded to other environments.
    It holds a unique position due to its tight integration with web technologies.
    Transpiled languages offer additional features on top of JavaScript's capabilities.
