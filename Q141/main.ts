// Question 141: Discuss the significance of the await reserved word in asynchronous JavaScript.

// Example use of the 'await' reserved word in asynchronous JavaScript
async function fetchData() {
    // Assuming fetchSomething returns a Promise
    const data = await fetchSomething();
    console.log(data);
    // The 'await' keyword pauses the execution until the Promise settles, and then resumes with the resolved value.
  }
  
  console.log(
    "The 'await' keyword allows asynchronous, promise-based behavior to be written in a cleaner, more linear fashion."
  );

/*This demonstrates how 'await' improves readability and flow in asynchronous code.
By using 'await', we can write asynchronous operations in a synchronous-like manner, where each step
in the code executes sequentially. This linear flow of control makes it easier to follow the logic
and understand the sequence of operations, especially in complex asynchronous scenarios. Additionally,
'await' allows us to handle errors and exceptions more naturally using try-catch blocks, enhancing
the overall maintainability and robustness of our code.*/
