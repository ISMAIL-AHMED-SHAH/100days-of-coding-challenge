Day 53 of #100DaysOfCodingChallenge! Today, I explored Chrome DevTools through a video clip provided by Sir Asharib Ali. Chrome DevTools is a powerful toolkit seamlessly integrated into the browser, offering essential features for web development:

By right-clicking on a webpage and selecting "Inspect," you'll find six main features at the top bar.

1. Inspect Button: Used to highlight an element on the page. Hovering over an element will show its code in the "Elements" panel. You can check and change its CSS styles, including size and layout. Other tabs include "Layout," "Event Listeners," "DOM Breakpoints," "Properties," and "Accessibility."

2. Toggle Device Toolbar: Shows how your application will look on different devices.

3. Console Panel: Verifies your code's logs, messages, and warnings. Errors are displayed with file names and line numbers, allowing for quick identification and resolution. You can set breakpoints in the code and debug it step by step. The console also serves as a playground for experimenting with JavaScript, where you can run scripts and manipulate elements on the page. The "$" sign is a shortcut for "document.querySelector()" for faster coding.

4. Sources Panel: Enables direct file editing and syncs edits to the workspace, enhancing development efficiency.

5. Network Panel: Performs network activities during webpage loading, aiding in error detection and resource optimization.

6. No Throttling: Simulates different user connection speeds, ensuring optimal website performance testing.

Additionally, DevTools can be customized according to preferences, such as theme, language, and keyboard shortcuts.
